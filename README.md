# 🚀 AWS Data Engineering & Analytics Pipeline  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project showcases an **end-to-end AWS Data Engineering and Analytics pipeline** that transforms raw data into actionable insights and predictive intelligence.  
It automates the entire data lifecycle — from **data ingestion** and **schema discovery** to **ETL processing**, **data warehousing**, **machine learning**, and **visualization** — delivering a robust, scalable foundation for cloud analytics.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture  
**Data Flow:**  
1. **Data Ingestion:** Raw datasets are collected and stored in **Amazon S3 (Raw Zone)**.  
2. **Schema Discovery:** **AWS Glue Crawler** automatically infers schema and creates a **Data Catalog**.  
3. **Data Transformation:** **Glue ETL jobs** clean, normalize, and enrich data into the **S3 Processed Zone**.  
4. **Data Warehousing:** Transformed data is loaded into **Amazon Redshift** for optimized querying and downstream analytics.  
5. **Querying & Exploration:** **Amazon Athena** enables serverless SQL-based exploration on both raw and processed datasets.  
6. **Machine Learning:** Processed data is passed to **Amazon SageMaker** to train predictive models for forecasting and business insights.  
7. **Visualization:** Cleaned and modeled data are visualized in **Power BI**, featuring 10+ KPIs for sales, profitability, and performance analysis.  
8. **Monitoring & Security:** **IAM roles/policies** manage permissions and **Amazon CloudWatch** monitors job execution and performance metrics.
